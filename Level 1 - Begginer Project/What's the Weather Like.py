"""
Create a program that asks the user about the current weather and, using a dictionary for decision-making, suggests an activity.

Start the script with this dictionary on top of your script:

weather_activities = {
    "1": "It's a beautiful day! How about a walk in the park? ðŸŒ³",
    "2": "Perfect weather for a cozy indoor day with a good book! ðŸ“š",
    "3": "Maybe it's a great time for a reflective cup of tea! â˜•",
    "4": "Build a snowman or have a snowball fight! â›„"
}

Then, add more code so the program produces the following output.

What's the weather like today?
1. Sunny
2. Rainy
3. Cloudy
4. Snowy 
Choose 1, 2, 3, or 4: 2

Perfect weather for a cozy indoor day with a good book! ðŸ“š

Stay Safe and enjoy the weather! ðŸŒˆ

1. The program prompts the user to choose 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the current weather.
2. Then, the program displays some text that belongs to the choice in the dictionary given further above.
